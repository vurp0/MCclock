# MCclock

Simple color watchface for the Pebble Time. Looks and acts like the Clock item from Minecraft.

It's very simple, it just divides the day into 64 parts and shows the corresponding frame from the clock animation.

Currently it only supports `basalt`, but it can be compiled for `aplite` too, just by editing the `appinfo.json`. It just won't look very good since there's no dithering on the monochrome display.
